    <p>The BEST Homemade Mac and Cheese of your LIFE. Outrageously cheesy, ultra creamy, and topped with a crunchy
        Panko-Parmesan topping, this mac and cheese recipe is most definitely a keeper. I used three different cheese
        and a homemade cheese sauce to take this macaroni and cheese recipe over the tope</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a large 3 qt or 4 qt baking dish and set aside.Combine shredded cheeses
            in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta one minute shy of al dente according to the package instructions. Remove from heat, drain,
            and place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle pasta with olive oil and stir to coat pasta. Set aside to cool while preparing cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a deep saucepan, dutch oven, or stock pot.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour over medium heat and continue whisking for about 1 minute until bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream until nice and smooth. Continue whisking until you see bubbles
            on the surface and then continue cooking and whisking for another 2 minutes. Whisk in salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add two cups of shredded cheese and whisk until smooth. Add another two cups of shredded cheese and continue
            whisking until creamy and smooth. Sauce should be nice and thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooled pasta until combined and pasta is fully coated with the cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the mac and cheese into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 2 cups of shredded cheese
            and then the remaining mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine panko crumbs, Parmesan cheese, melted butter and paprika. Sprinkle over the top and
            bake until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
